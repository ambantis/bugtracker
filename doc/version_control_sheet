    Changed com.x460dot11.data.Database.updateBug method by syncronized.
    
    Now, users can request edit pages as much as they want, but once they enter the method, it is locked so that no other thread can make any updates (editBug.jsp). Once it enters the method, there is a second check to query the existing bug record that the user started with versus what currently exists in the database. Thus, there is a double check to guard against lost updates.

    Changed edit bug process to prevent lost updates.
    
    Before a Database processes an editBug request, it queries bugdb for the updated value of the bug being edited. If the values are not the same (between the original version the user edited and what is currently in the database, then the update operation is aborted and throws an exception.

Date:   Sun Sep 2 18:51:42 2012 -0700

    Refactored object database persistence.
    
    1) instead of having connection details within a PostgresBugDAO object, the connection information is included within web.xml as context-parameters.
    2) the ContextListener now implements contextInitialized by establishing a connection and then setting that connection as a Servlet Init Parameter.
    3) com.x460dot11.Hibernator contains a public static method that takes as its argument a connection and returns an ArrayList of bugs, via a query to bugdb
    4) the com.x460dot11.servlet.ServletLogin gets the connection parameter and uses it to create an ArrayList of bugs, and then sets this array list as a session parameter.
    5) the welcome.jsp the grabs the bugs session parameter and uses a jsp:forEach loop to print out the bug ids in a table.
